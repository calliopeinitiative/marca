Marca is a web application designed especially for writers and can be used throughout the writing process, 
from collecting research, to brainstorming, to drafting, through peer review, instructor grading and commenting, 
and revision. Marca is designed to foster a writing community in the classroom by providing both public and private
spaces where students can collect their work and receive feedback from their peers as well as their instructor.

Marca is developed and supported by The Calliope Initiative
The Calliope Initiative offers hosting, support, consulting, and development for the Marca writing web application.
